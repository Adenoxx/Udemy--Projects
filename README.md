PROJECTS

This is a collection of code along projects, assignments and tasks from Udemy courses by Jonas Schmedtman.
These courses cover core frontend technologies - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Nextjs.

My first commit are from the DOM manipulation section of the JavaScript course. Where we use classes to update, style and make interactions on a webpage.
